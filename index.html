        <h1>Feature-Dependent Naive Bayes for Software Defect Prediction</h1>
        <p>
            Feature-dependent Naive Bayes is an extension of the classic Naive Bayes algorithm that considers the impact of individual features on defect prediction. It takes into account feature weights and dependencies.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Points:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Features are not assumed to be equally important.</li>
            <li>Dependencies between features are considered.</li>
            <li>Weighted probabilities are used for classification.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In software defect prediction, this approach can lead to more accurate predictions by incorporating feature-specific information. It's particularly useful when certain features have varying impacts on defect proneness.
        </p>
        <p>
            To apply this approach:
            <ol>
                <li>Collect historical data with feature values and corresponding defect labels.</li>
                <li>Calculate feature weights based on their relevance.</li>
                <li>Construct the weighted Naive Bayes classifier.</li>
                <li>Evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
